## About
This project was a <strong>classroom assignment</strong> for the <strong>[University of Birmingham Full-Stack Development Coding Bootcamp](https://gist.github.com/djbowen95/2846640d520a16165b9b23db2d9e0926)</strong>: a 24-week intensive coding bootcamp programme that aimed to teach us the full-range of skills required for <strong>front-end</strong>, <strong>back-end</strong> and <strong>React development</strong>. This project was assigned during <strong>Week 18</strong>, which covered <strong>NoSQL Databases with MongoDB</strong>.
